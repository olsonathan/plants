    Comments:	"A new release from North Carolina State, it's rapidly replacing Beauregard in commercial plantings. Not because of flavor, both are sweet with great flavor. And it isn't because of yield, they are both very good yielders. In truth, there are three key differences; 1) Storage time is much longer than Beauregard (which can begin to deteriorate beginning in January). 2) Covington roots are very uniform in shape and not prone to produce misshapen or long, narrow roots. (Georgia Jet is especially prone to misshapen roots and football-sized lunkers that are hard to bake or process.) 3) Covington is resistant to Russet crack and Southern root-knot nematode, either of which can make growing sweet potatoes very discouraging!",

Tolerant to verticillium wilt, fusarium wilt race 1 and 2, alternararia stem canker and stemphylium, and resistant to cracking. Indeterminate tomatoes continue to grow, flower, and set fruit until killed by the first frost in the Fall. Accordingly, the harvest from indeterminate varieties often extends over a 2 or 3 month period. Yields are generally heavier than determinate types, but are usually later to mature. Indeterminate tomatoes are tall, sprawling plants which often perform best when supported by stakes or a tall wire cage. Indeterminate varieties that are staked can be planted 1 1/2 to 2 feet apart in the row. Allow a 2 - 3-foot spacing for indeterminate plants grown in wire cages, while tomatoes allowed to sprawl over the ground should be spaced 3 to 4 feet apart.",

    Soil:	"Organic, well-drained, slightly acidic, sandy, loamy soil.",
    Pruning:	"It is only necessary to prune dead, thin, crossing, and diseased branches. For easiest maintenance, the plant can be mowed down to ground level in early spring. However, this will result in losing the first crop of berries in early June, The second crop of berries will still develop in late summer to frost.",
    Comments:	"This raspberry has it all-flavor, productivity, disease resistance, and beauty! Enjoy the intense flavor of the gorgeous, shiny, dark red-purple fruit twice a year-first in early summer, then again from late summer to frost. The dark red-purple color of its thick, sturdy canes adds to its ornamental effect in the landscape. This vigorous variety tends to have more of a compact growth habit in colder, northern climates, which makes it an excellent choice for container gardening. Particularly good for farm stand growers who want to offer a more unique variety, with excellent flavor and rich color.",

    Pruning:	"Root only 5 or 6 runners from each plant and remove the rest. Arrange the runners to the ground and plant and remove the rest. Arrange the runners so they're about 6 inches apart. Everbearers should not bear fruit with the first flush of flowers since they need their strength to establish the main plant and to sprout runners. Pinch or cut off the first flowers that form, allowing the flowers later in the season to produce fruit.",
    Size:	"1/2 + inch flowers.",
    Comments:	"Our favorite, popular everbearer is famous for its large yields of bright red, unusually large berries. Ozark Beauty plants set delicious fruit from June through September. Everbearing strawberries deliver fruit all Summer, with a large initial harvest and a steady crop the rest of the season. Like Junebearers, they are very easy to grow and will do well most anywhere. Plant both Junebearers and Everbearers for a constant supply of fresh fruit. High sugar content. Thrives in any soil. Unusually vigorous plants with a deep root system. Resistant to leaf spot and leaf scorch. Especially good for the North and in Southern mountain states.",
